# pandemic-sim
Outbreak simulator inspired by (or rather, ripped of from) https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/

This is just a toy. I'm not an epidemiologist, you're probably neither, so don't use results of this simulation for anything other than superficial illustration purposes.
